A couple of months back, I was having issues with my Trooli broadband.  My download speed would drop all the way to near 0. But ping weren't dropping any packets.  I wrote this quick project to monitor and store my bandwidth history in a MySQL db so I can graph and keep an eye on whats going on.  

Trooli eventually replaced the NTU which proved to be the issue.
