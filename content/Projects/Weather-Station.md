Data from the weather station in my garden. I have an old CCTV camera taking pictures of the sky every 5 minutes. I'm then autogenerating the webm of the previous days sky as timelapse. [My Weather Website](https://weather.lloyd.ws) the data is also posted to [Wundergound](https://www.wunderground.com/dashboard/pws/ISOUTH1316)
