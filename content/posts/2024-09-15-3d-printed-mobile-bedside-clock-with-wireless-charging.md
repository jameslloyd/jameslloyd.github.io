Designed this model to hold me Pixel 9 Pro with the [Bellroy case](https://bellroy.com/products/leather-pixel-case?color=terracotta&material=leather&size=pixel9proxl#slide-0) on it.  It uses [THIS](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/296652256588) wireless charger from ebay, this allows the magsafe charger to hold the phone in the "dock", quite nicely.

The wiresless charger is held in with some vhb tape. Any charger will do as long as its a circle of 56mm or less diameter, you'll probably want a usb C one else you'll need to cut off a USB A connector to allow you to pass it through the hole.

You can find the files to print on [Thingaverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6767101)
