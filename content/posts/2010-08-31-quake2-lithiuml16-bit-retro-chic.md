Many many moons ago when my Voodoo 3DFX card was the height of PC chic. I had my first Multiplayer FPS experience with Quake2.  Up until that point, multiplayer gaming meant playing red alert with a friend and a rather shonky serial cross over cable.  Many hours were waisted and many many MB's of space taken up with extra maps and models.  Models that almost instantly got banned due to being impossible to see, and effectively making you invisible to your opponents.  And many frags were clocked up whilst grappling madly around the map with the Lithium MOD. Fun was had by all then we moved on to newer games with slightly higher resolutions and slightly better textures, that were never quite as much fun as the original Quake 2 Lithuim experience.

Well <Farnsworth>Good News Everybody</Farnsworth> as is the current trend to revive all those 8-bit games, now is the time to relive the 16-bit age, after all the only decent thing to come out 8-bit was Gauntlet 2. Where this rather inarticulate ramble is going is that Quake 2 Lithium has been reborn at [Quake2Lithium.com](http://Quake2Lithium.com).

And im currently involved in building a statistics engine for the scene based on a V2 of the q2stats that myself and Darren built in 2008. They can be found at ~~q2stats.com~~.  
**Update 2022**: q2stats was put in github and archived.  It can be found here [q2stats repo]()
