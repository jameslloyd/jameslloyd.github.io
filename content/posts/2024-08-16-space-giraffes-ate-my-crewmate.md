**Short Pitch**: When a routine mission to the International Space Station turns deadly, astronaut Commander Alex Mason returns to Earth with a bizarre tale of extraterrestrial murder. Haunted by the gruesome death of his partner and the horrifying sight of the Space Giraffes responsible, Mason embarks on a desperate quest to warn the world of the leafy green-loving menace lurking beyond the stars. But as his sanity unravels and the evidence mounts against him, Mason must confront a chilling truth: the real danger might not be in outer space, but within himself.
In the end its obviously the giraffes

## [SCENE]

TV News Anchor (TNA): Good evening, and thank you for joining us for this special broadcast. We're speaking with astronaut Commander Alex Mason, recently returned from the International Space Station under tragic circumstances. Commander Mason, our condolences for the loss of your partner, Dr. Emily Chen.

Commander Mason (CM): Thank you. It's...it's been difficult.

**TNA**: We understand you were the only two crew members aboard the ISS at the time of Dr. Chen's death. Could you describe what happened?

**CM**: (hesitantly) It's not easy to talk about. Emily... she was attacked. Brutally.

**TNA**: By who? Was there an intruder aboard the station?

**CM**: No. There was no one else human, that is.

**TNA**: What do you mean?

**CM**: (takes a deep breath) It was Space Giraffes.

**TNA**: (clearly taken aback) Space...Giraffes?

**CM**: Yes. They're real. I know it sounds absurd, but I saw them. Huge, majestic creatures, floating through the vacuum, with their long necks and spotted hides. They're not hostile, usually, but this time... they were different.

**TNA**: Are you suggesting these... Space Giraffes are responsible for Dr. Chen's death?

**CM**: (nods) I saw them do it. Their eyes were glowing, their movements unnatural. They ripped through the station like a whirlwind. Emily didn't stand a chance.
**TNA**: This is an extraordinary claim, Commander. Do you have any evidence to support this?

**CM**: I know it sounds crazy. But there were signs. Giraffe-shaped bite marks on the equipment, hoof prints in zero gravity. And the food stores... all the lettuce was gone.

**TNA**: Lettuce?

**CM**: They love lettuce. It's their favorite.

**TNA**: Commander Mason, I have to ask... are you feeling alright? This has been a traumatic experience.

**CM**: I'm perfectly fine. I know what I saw. And I need to warn people. The Space Giraffes are out there. They're dangerous. We need to be prepared.

**TNA**: (looks into the camera with a troubled expression) We've heard a shocking account from Commander Mason tonight. We'll continue to follow this story and bring you updates as they become available. In the meantime, we urge everyone to remain calm and... vigilant. (turns back to Mason) Commander, thank you for your time.

**CM**: (stares intently into the camera) Remember... the lettuce. It's the key. It was always me. (The broadcast cuts abruptly to a commercial break)
